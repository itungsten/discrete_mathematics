    \item[7]What do the connected components of acquaintanceship graphs represent?\\\\
        For any two people (A,B) in the same component, we can find out a set of acquaintances for us as a bridge to start walking with A and end with B.


    \item[11]Determine whether each of these graphs is strongly connected and if not, whether it is weakly connected.  \\

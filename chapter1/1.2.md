a) $q \rightarrow p$

b) $ q \land \lnot p$

c) $q \rightarrow p$

d) $\lnot q \rightarrow \lnot p$

No, these system specification are not consistent.

$Proof:$

Let's define

The system is in multiuser state    as     $p$

It is operating normally   as    $q$

The kernel is functioning   as 	$r$

The system is in interrupt mode	as	$s$

We have:

$1.\lnot s \qquad 2.\lnot p \rightarrow s	\qquad 3.p \leftrightarrow q \qquad	4.q \rightarrow r	\qquad 5.\lnot r \lor s$

Then:

$p$     (P1,P2,Modus Tollens)

$q$ 	(1,P3,biconditional)

$r$	 (2,P4,implication)

$r \to s$ (P5)

$\lnot r$	(P1,4,Modus Tollens)

According to 4,5, they are not consistent.

$Ans:$

The first and the second professor wanted coffee while the third one didn't want it.

$Proof:$

Let's define

The first professor wanted coffee	as 	$p$

The second professor wanted coffee	as 	$q$

The third professor wanted coffee	as 	$r$

We have:（According to the first and the second professors didn't know whether all of them wanted coffee or not）

$1.p\qquad 2.q \qquad 3.\lnot(p \land q \land r)$

Then:

$\lnot p \lor \lnot q \lor \lnot r$ 	(P3, De Morgan's law)

$\lnot r$	(P1,P2,1)

According to P1,P2,2 we can draw our conclusion.

$Q.E.D$



##### 23

$Ans:$ A is knave and B is knight

$Proof:$

Let's define:

A is knight	 as 	$p$

B is knight	as 	$q$

We have: 

$1.p \rightarrow (\lnot p \and \lnot q) \qquad 2.\lnot  p \rightarrow \lnot(\lnot p \land \lnot q)$ 

Then:

$\lnot p \lor ( \lnot p \land \lnot q)$	(P1,implication)

$(\lnot p \lor \lnot p) \land (\lnot p \lor \lnot q)$	(1,distribution)

$\lnot p \land (\lnot p \lor \lnot q)$	(2,idempotent)

$\lnot p$	(3,absorption)

$\lnot( \lnot p \land \lnot q)$	(4,P2,implication)

$p \lor q$	(5,DevMorgan's law)

$q$ 	(4,6)

$Q.E.D$



##### 33

$Ans:$

Fred>Maggie>Janice

$Proof:$

Let's define:

Fred is the highest paid of the three	as	$p$

Janice is the second	as	$q$

Janice is the lowest paid	as	$r$

Maggie is paid the most	as	$s$

We have (at least):

$1.\lnot p \rightarrow q \qquad 2.\lnot r \rightarrow s$

Then:
